# Linear Regression 101

Linear regression is one of the simplest and most widely used machine learning algorithms
for regression tasks. It's a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting the value
of a continuous target variable based on one or more input features.

## Important Questions ##

1.  What is machine learning?
2.  Supervised learning algorithm?
3.  What is exactly Linear Regression?

## Answers ##

1. Machine learning is a way for computers to learn from data and improve over time without being explicitly programmed.
Instead of following specific instructions, machines use algorithms to analyze large sets of data, find patterns, and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns. It's like teaching a computer to recognize patterns and make decisions on its own.


2. Type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data. In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a dataset that includes both input data and the corresponding correct output. The goal is for the algorithm to learn a mapping from the input to the output, so that when it's given new input data, it can predict the corresponding output.

3. We need to wait for practical example to see it. heh

# Example time - What is line/linear/graph?

Draw:

y = 0.5 * x + 2
